In the project, the team has used framework of Scrum to accomplish the software development documentation. 
The use of Scrum framework is varied to an extent since not all the requirements are met for the freamework. 
In case of three roles in Scrum, the project description is considered as the product owner as all the changes and requirements are given in the description. 
For the development team, all the team members contribute as part of the development team. 
There is no fixed Scrum master because we all work as the same and manage together in order to let everyone experience the all the roles of Scrum.
Sprint period is changed to one week and the team members ensure to finish assigned tasks within one week. 
We make sure to finish our assigned tasks every sprint and no new one is assigned during the sprint. 
Most Scrum events are combined to one event with almost one and a half hour of time. We used tutorial time as the combined Sprint planning, Sprint review and Sprint retrospective event. All the discussion, evaluations, and assigning are done in one time. 
Since not all members is available everyday to make daily Scrum, we avoid to do the daily scrum.
